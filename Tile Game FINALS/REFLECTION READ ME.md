# 2D-Minecraft-Game
FEATURES: 17 Blocks, 2 Liquids
Chest can store items and if broken they will drop their items
Items are dropped when blocks are broken and float in water (I did not have time to add floating compatibility with lava)
There is randomly generating terrain in which manipulating the world seed would yeild different terrain types
There is infinite terrain in BOTH the horizontal and vertical direction. If you go left or right enough you can see a "wall" and pass through it. The same goes for up and down.

There is one structure which is the tree

There is an lighting system

There is a cave system, and lava and water SHOULD generate in caves

There is ore generation (different ores generate at different y levels)

UNFINISHED FEATURES:
I tried to add a save and load world feature. Saving works but loading dosent work and I am out of time so I cant fix it

The lighting system is bugged at the edges of each chunk (blocks appear too dark)

I planned to add a crafting system as seen with the crafting table GUI and block but I ran out of time

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS:
The hardest part of this project is implimenting the lighting system and working on this project while having finals and tests in other classes since its towards the end of the semester. The second hardest would be

I learned the most at HashMaps<> since before, I never used them. In the game, they are vital to the 2d infinite chunk system

I will finish the rest of this since my parents suprized me with an unannoced 2 hour physcis class
